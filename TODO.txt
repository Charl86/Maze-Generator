TODO:
    1) Instead of creating a border and make the cells fit inside it,
        if order to have a border, I could just have a starting cell
        at at a distance from the edge which I would call my "border",
        and then have the actual border fit around the cells.
    2) Fix the padding issue with regards to to-do 1).
